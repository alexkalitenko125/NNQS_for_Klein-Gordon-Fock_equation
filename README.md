NNQS for the Klein--Gordon--Fock equation

In this article, we present a method for finding quantum stationary states using the Klein--Gordon--Fock (KGF) equation and neural networks (NNs). The method has been tested on two well-known systems: a relativistic spinless particle in a Coulomb potential, and a one-dimensional relativistic harmonic oscillator. The results of training the neural network for these two systems are presented, as well as the analysis of the training process. The neural network method shows good agreement with analytical calculations, when can we find them, providing a promising approach for solving more complex problems in quantum physics and  quantum chemistry.

$$[E-V]^2 \psi(x) = \left[ -\hbar^2 c^2 \frac{d^2}{dx^2}+ m^2c^4 \right]\psi(x)$$
