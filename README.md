# NNQS_for_Klein-Gordon-Fock_equation
NNQS for the Klein--Gordon--Fock equation

A method for searching for quantum stationary states using the Klein-Gordon-Fock equation and neural networks (NNs) is proposed. The method is based on the variational principle and has been tested on two well-known systems: a hydrogen-like atom without considering the electron spin, and a harmonic oscillator.  It can be used for other tasks. The material is currently being prepared for publication.
